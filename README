AlON - minimally dynamic web framework
----------

AlON is targeted at high traffic sites with content that changes gradually, such as webcomics, blogs, and news sites.

The concept of "Dynamic" and "Static" sites are not binary, they exist as two ends of a continuum.
Most site frameworks exist to service one end of this continuum. For example jekyll or hakyll are just static site generators - when anything changes you have to run them again to generate a new site. A framework like snap is entirely dynamic and produces the reply entirely each time with no inherent concept of something not having changed.

Sometimes you want something that understands the in between. AlON does incremental, minimal, website regeneration as data or conditions change.

AlON can read from a variety of dynamically changing data sources, such as:

 - dirSource: A directory structure (via inotify/FSEvents).
 - time: The current time.
 - gitDir: The most recent commit in a specific repository's branch's Tree. (Not yet implemented)

AlON then transforms this data into a site, via a Haskell specification, automatically tracking what was required to generate each result. When some of the source data for a specific result changes, AlON regenerates just those results that are affected. AlON can then send a minimal set of invalidations to a CDN, selecting an optimal set of invalidation commands based on the change set and the CDN's API usage policy.

AlON allows "dynamic" type site additions via WAI plugins. From such plugins people on the web could manipulate AlON data sources, causing AlON to regenerate the site. Truly "dynamic" actions, such as random redirects, can be implemented similarly.
